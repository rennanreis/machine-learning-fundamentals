# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Fundamentals** project! This repository is dedicated to providing an educational series on fundamental machine learning concepts, with practical implementations and examples.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to guide users through the essential concepts of machine learning, starting with basic theory and progressing into hands-on experiments using real-world datasets.

### Current Focus:
**Article 1: What is Machine Learning?**
- This article introduces the concept of machine learning (ML), its types, and an initial hands-on experiment using the Iris dataset.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `article-1-what-is-ml/`: Resources for the first article, including data, notebooks, scripts, and results.
    - `data/`: Datasets used in the experiments.
        - `raw/`: Original data (not modified).
        - `processed/`: Processed or cleaned data, ready for analysis.
    - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the practical implementation of the article's concepts.
    - `scripts/`: Helper functions for preprocessing and analysis.
    - `article.md`: Full article text ready for publication.
    - `README.md`: Documentation for this article and its resources.

- `results/`: Results of experiments and outputs.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project, including the roadmap, strategy, and style guide.
- `environment.yml`: Defines the global environment for the project.
- `LICENSE`: License for the project (MIT).
- `.gitignore`: Files to be ignored by Git (e.g., temporary files, environment directories).

## Setting Up the Environment

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up your environment using **conda**:

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-fundamentals.git
cd machine-learning-fundamentals
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
We recommend using **conda** to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. Run the following command to create and activate a conda environment named `machine-learning-fundamentals-env`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate machine-learning-fundamentals-env
```

### 3. Running the Jupyter Notebook
To begin working with the notebooks, you can start a Jupyter Notebook session by running the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open Jupyter in your browser, and you can begin working with the notebooks in the appropriate folder.
