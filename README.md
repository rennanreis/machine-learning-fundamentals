# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Fundamentals** project! This repository is dedicated to providing an educational series on fundamental machine learning concepts, with practical implementations and examples.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to guide users through the essential concepts of machine learning, starting with basic theory and progressing into hands-on experiments using real-world datasets.

### Current and Upcoming Articles

1. **What is Machine Learning?** *(current focus)*:
   - Introduction to ML concepts, types, and a practical experiment using the Iris dataset.

2. **Supervised Learning Fundamentals** *(future content)*:
   - A deep dive into classification and regression techniques.

3. **Unsupervised Learning Fundamentals** *(future content)*:
   - Exploration of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

4. **Evaluation Metrics** *(future content)*:
   - Understanding model evaluation and performance metrics.

5. **Beyond Basics** *(future content)*:
   - Introduction to deep learning and advanced ML topics.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `article-<n>-<topic>/`: Resources for each article in the series, containing:
    - `data/`: Datasets used in experiments.
        - `raw/`: Original datasets.
        - `processed/`: Preprocessed datasets.
    - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with hands-on examples.
    - `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and analysis.
    - `results/`: Outputs and visualizations from the experiments.
    - `article.md`: Full article text ready for publication.
    - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the article.

- `results/`: Consolidated outputs and results from all experiments.
- `docs/`: All supporting documentation for the project.
- `environment.yml`: A configuration file for replicating the project environment.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license (MIT).
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.

This structure ensures that all resources related to a specific article are organized and easily accessible.

### How Articles and Code Work Together

Each article in the series is paired with dedicated resources in the repository. These resources include:

- **Datasets**: Raw and processed data for the experiments discussed in the article.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks implementing the concepts covered in the article.
- **Scripts**: Python files providing preprocessing or reusable utilities.
- **Results**: Visualizations, metrics, or other outputs generated during the experiments.

These resources ensure that readers can move seamlessly from theory to practice.

## Documentation

This project includes comprehensive documentation to ensure consistency and alignment. The following files are available in the `docs/` folder:

- **Writing Guidelines for Articles**: [article-guideline.md](docs/article-guideline.md)  
  Provides a detailed structure for creating consistent and professional articles.  
- **General Style Guide**: [guideline.md](docs/guideline.md)  
  Offers style and formatting guidelines for notebooks, scripts, and general development.  
- **Roadmap**: [roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)  
  Outlines the planned progression of the series, including future articles and milestones.  
- **Strategy Document**: [strategy.md](docs/strategy.md)  
  Describes how the articles, experiments, and repository structure align to deliver a cohesive learning experience.

## Setting Up the Environment

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up your environment using **conda**:

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-fundamentals.git
cd machine-learning-fundamentals
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
We recommend using **conda** to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. Run the following command to create and activate a conda environment named `machine-learning-fundamentals-env`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate machine-learning-fundamentals-env
```

### 3. Running the Jupyter Notebook
To begin working with the notebooks, you can start a Jupyter Notebook session by running the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open Jupyter in your browser, and you can begin working with the notebooks in the appropriate folder.
