# Project Strategy - Machine Learning Fundamentals

This document describes the strategy for developing and aligning the articles, experiments, and GitHub repository for the **Machine Learning Fundamentals** series.

## Strategy Outline
1. **Integration of Articles and Code**
   - Each article will be accompanied by a corresponding folder in the repository containing:
     - Data
     - Jupyter notebooks
     - Supporting scripts
     - Results

2. **Consistency Across Content**
   - Use consistent style and formatting across all articles, notebooks, and scripts.
   - Follow the guidelines outlined in `guideline.md`.

3. **Audience Engagement**
   - Ensure that each article is self-contained, providing theoretical explanations and practical examples.
   - Publish the articles on Medium and link to the GitHub repository for hands-on resources.

4. **Technical Stack**
   - Use Python 3.8 with standard ML libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
   - Maintain an environment.yml file for easy environment setup.

## Publication Plan
- **Platform**: Medium
- **Frequency**: Publish one article per month (flexible based on progress).
- **Promotion**: Share articles on social media and relevant communities.
