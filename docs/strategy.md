# Project Strategy - Machine Learning Fundamentals

This document describes the strategy for developing and aligning the articles, experiments, and GitHub repository for the **Machine Learning Fundamentals** series.

## Strategy Outline
1. **Integration of Articles and Code**
   - Each article will be accompanied by a corresponding folder in the repository containing:
     - Data
     - Jupyter notebooks
     - Supporting scripts
     - Results
   - The notebooks will align with the article content, providing hands-on implementation and reinforcing theoretical concepts.

2. **Consistency Across Content**
   - Use consistent style and formatting across all articles, notebooks, and scripts.
   - Follow the guidelines outlined in `guideline.md` for style and structure.
   - Articles will adhere to the structure defined in `article-guideline.md` for consistency in tone, content, and presentation.

3. **Audience Engagement**
   - Ensure that each article is self-contained, providing theoretical explanations and practical examples.
   - Articles will focus on accessibility and clarity for beginner and intermediate learners, avoiding excessive jargon.
   - Publish articles on Medium and link to the GitHub repository for hands-on resources.
   - Encourage readers to participate in hands-on experimentation by referring to corresponding GitHub notebooks.

4. **Technical Stack**
   - Use Python 3.8 with standard ML libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
   - Maintain an `environment.yml` file for easy environment setup and reproducibility.
   - Ensure that all code is well-commented, tested, and functional.

## Publication Plan
- **Platform**: Medium
- **Frequency**: Publish one article per month (flexible based on progress).
- **Promotion**: Share articles on social media and relevant communities (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, etc.).

## Timeline and Milestones
1. **Month 1-2**: Complete Articles 1 and 2 (What is Machine Learning? and Supervised Learning Fundamentals).
2. **Month 3-4**: Focus on Articles 3 and 4 (Unsupervised Learning Fundamentals and Evaluation Metrics).
3. **Month 5-6**: Article 5 (Beyond Basics: Advanced Topics), explore deep learning resources.

**Note**: Timelines are flexible depending on progress, feedback, and content updates.

## Experiment and GitHub Repository
- Each article will be paired with a dedicated GitHub repository section containing:
  - Datasets (raw and processed).
  - Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the concepts in the article.
  - Supporting Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
  - Results of experiments (e.g., model evaluation metrics, visualizations).
- Repositories will be updated regularly as new articles are published and experiments are conducted.
