1. **What is Machine Learning?**
   - Introduction to ML concepts and types.
   - Hands-on example with the Iris dataset.

2. **Supervised Learning Fundamentals**
   - Deep dive into supervised learning.
   - Examples with regression and classification tasks.

3. **Unsupervised Learning Fundamentals**
   - Introduction to clustering and dimensionality reduction.
   - Hands-on examples with real-world data.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Overview of key metrics for evaluating ML models.
   - Examples with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall.

5. **Beyond Basics: Advanced Topics**
   - An introduction to deep learning and neural networks.
   - Future directions and resources for further learning.

## Goals and Milestones
- Provide accessible and practical resources for learning ML.
- Align each article with a corresponding GitHub project for hands-on learning.
- Publish the series on Medium and maintain the repository as an open-source resource.
