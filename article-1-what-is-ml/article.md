# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. This article introduces key concepts, types of ML, and their applications.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms explore data without predefined labels.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment.

### Practical Example: The Iris Dataset

In this example, we explore the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in Machine Learning. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

#### Goals:
- Train a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower.
- Demonstrate the principles of **Supervised Learning** through a hands-on example.

#### Implementation:
The experiment is fully documented in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook:  
[notebooks/what_is_ml.ipynb](notebooks/what_is_ml.ipynb)

We use:
1. **Logistic Regression** for classification.
2. Basic metrics like accuracy to evaluate the model.
3. Visualizations to understand the relationships in the dataset.

## Conclusion
Machine learning is transforming industries by enabling systems to learn and adapt from data. Stay tuned for more in-depth articles in this series.
