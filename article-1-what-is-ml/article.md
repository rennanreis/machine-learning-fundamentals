# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. This article introduces key concepts, types of ML, and their applications.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms explore data without predefined labels.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment.

## Practical Experiment
We built a simple supervised learning model using the Iris dataset. You can find the full implementation [here](notebooks/what_is_ml.ipynb).

## Conclusion
Machine learning is transforming industries by enabling systems to learn and adapt from data. Stay tuned for more in-depth articles in this series.
